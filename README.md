# AI-Child-Speech-Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a research project focused on **The Use of Artificial Intelligence to Detect Speech Characteristics in Elementary School Children with Speech Disorders**. The goal is to provide an automated, AI-driven tool to assist specialists in the early identification and analysis of phonological and speech disorders.

## Key Features
- **Speech Signal Processing**: Extraction of acoustic features using Librosa.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilization of [mention your model, e.g., CNN or Transformers] for classification.
- **Child-Centric Data**: Optimized to handle the unique speech characteristics of primary school students.

## Project Structure
- `/data`: Sample datasets or links to resources.
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and training.
- `/src`: Core Python scripts for processing and inference.
- `/models`: Saved model weights (e.g., .h5 or .tflite).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Librosa
- Streamlit (if used for the UI)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/AI-Child-Speech-Analysis.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/AI-Child-Speech-Analysis.git)
